Asteroids based game where squares spawn at random points on the edge of the screen and fly across.
If the player comes in contact with a square, the player dies and everything is reset.

The speed of the incoming squares, as well as the rate of their spawning incrementally increase as the game goes on, and all values (including rate of change) are determined by the difficulty.
